# E2C1

Here, you can find the sampled data for the capstone in CAV format.

500 issues were sampled. The title was chosen as x and the most relevant/best comment was chosen as z. This can be found in the file [here](https://github.com/mmgxa/E2C1/raw/main/END2%20-%20Sampled%20-%20Sheet1.csv). 

Next, the z's were rephrased to y. This can be found in the file [here](https://github.com/mmgxa/E2C1/raw/main/END2%20-%20Filtered%20-%20Submit%20-%20Sheet1.csv). 

Many of the samples had to be dropped. The reasons were:

- duplicate issues
- incomplete discussion/answer
- Many issues are resolved with pull requests and simplify refer to another URL.
- Some issues are syntax questions/help and the user is referred to discuss.pytorch.org
